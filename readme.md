3. PROPOSED MODEL

In our relentless pursuit of crafting a resilient and efficient cloud infrastructure for a dynamic social media platform, we lay the foundations for a user-centric experience guided by cutting-edge cloud architecture. The user's interactions with the system commence at the Load Balancer, a pivotal component that employs a sophisticated algorithm. Traffic is intelligently redirected to the database server with the least number of active connections, ensuring an even utilization of all available resources and optimizing system performance.

Once past the Load Balancer, requests embark on a journey that leverages the power of the Redis cache. This dedicated Redis cache server serves as the linchpin for the system, significantly enhancing the system's ability to manage read heavy operations. Frequently accessed data is strategically cached, mitigating the need for repeated retrieval from the original source and resulting in remarkably improved query response times.

Our architectural blueprint takes shape through the judicious incorporation of Relational (MySQL), Document (MongoDB), and Graph (Neo4j) databases, each contributing to the overall efficiency of the system. These databases are meticulously structured and equipped with horizontal partitioning and sharding capabilities (MySQL and MongoDB). The implementation of these strategies ensures the effective distribution of data across multiple servers, elevating query performance to a level of unparalleled efficiency.

High availability stands as a cornerstone of our architectural design. Through the deployment of database replicas, we

ensure uninterrupted service and fault tolerance. A secondary Load Balancer plays the role of the conductor, evenly directing ”read-heavy” traffic to these replicas. The system operates under the banner of strong consistency, achieving data uniformity and enhancing efficiency by directing read requests to the replicas first. Furthermore, these databases engage in periodic synchronization to safeguard data consistency, even in the face of potential challenges.

The architecture's robustness is further underscored by the foresight to empower database replicas with the ability to send continuous operational signals to the central server. In the event of a primary database failure, a random replica is poised to seamlessly take the reins, ensuring uninterrupted service for our users.

Data Migration is seamlessly woven into our architectural tapestry. This feature orchestrates the smooth transition of data between databases, providing the agility required for system upgrades and data consolidation. We have created scripts to convert MySQL databases to MongoDB and vice versa, anticipating scenarios where a decision might be made to migrate to a different database. The integrity of data remains paramount, and data migration is executed with a laser focus on minimizing data loss during this essential process.

As we ascend the summit of cloud architecture, we fortify the framework with an impregnable layer of security. Database Encryption stands as the sentry guarding data, both at rest and in transit, while Auditing and Logging mechanisms tirelessly keep watch over the system's activities. This emphasis on security, compliance, and troubleshooting is essential, ensuring that data remains protected.

Adding another layer of sophistication, we introduce Kafka, a robust messaging system. In our ecosystem, the master database acts as the producer of queries, pushing them to the message queue. The read replicas, or slaves, fetch these queries from the queue, updating themselves in a synchronized fashion. This Kafka-driven architecture ensures seamless communication and synchronization between the master and its replicas.

In our commitment to real-time responsiveness, we implement an auto-expiry feature for the cache. This deliberate choice is made to ensure that cached data remains fresh and reflective of real-time changes, aligning with our pursuit of optimal user experiences. Additionally, we incorporate an SMS alert system using the Twilio API to notify administrators in case of any failure or alarming situation, such as when query times exceed a predefined threshold. This proactive alerting mechanism enhances the system's robustness and aids in a swift response to potential issues.

In essence, our cloud architecture stands as a testament to innovation and foresight, where each component is intricately designed to contribute to the system's efficiency, resilience, and user satisfaction.
